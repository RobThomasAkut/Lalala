            <h1>Hi<br>I'm <span>Rob Thomas Akut</span><br>a BSIT Student</h1>
            <p>I am a first-year student for a BSIT degree. I love technologies and solving problems. At this time, I am learning more about the exciting world of IT and want to establish a strong basis in programming, network systems, and software development. The journey I have undertaken so far has allowed me to develop coding languages like Python, Java, and HTML, along with the basics of computer hardware and systems architecture.

                Beyond my pursuits, I value kindness and strive to create meaningful connections with the people around me. Whether on the field, in the classroom, or online, I approach every challenge with dedication, a positive attitude, and a drive to grow. Welcome to my portfolio, where I share my journey, projects, and passions!

        <h2>How I see myself 8 years from now on?</h2>
        <p>
            In 8 years, I envision myself as a successful stock trader with a deep understanding of the markets, navigating the world with the freedom and flexibility that comes with remote work. By then, I will have developed a strong, disciplined trading strategy and cultivated a mindset focused on long-term growth, both financially and personally. My journey will not only be about financial success but also about the experiences and insights gained while traveling across different countries. 

            I’ll be immersing myself in new cultures, building connections with like-minded traders from around the globe, and continuously expanding my horizons. Whether I’m trading from a bustling café in Tokyo or from a quiet beach in Bali, my work will be a reflection of my passion for both the financial markets and the world itself. I will have achieved a balance of independence, financial freedom, and personal growth, all while living a life rich in adventure and discovery.        </p>
