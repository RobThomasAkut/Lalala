            <h1>My Favorite Lesson in BSIT: <span>Computer Programming 1</span><br></h1>
            <p>Out of all the subjects in my BSIT course, Computer Programming 1 stands out as my favorite. It was the first class that truly ignited my passion for technology and problem-solving. In this course, I learned not just the syntax of programming languages but the foundational logic that underpins all software development. The thrill of transforming an abstract idea into a functioning program—watching the code come to life—was incredibly satisfying.

            <p>
                What I appreciate most about Computer Programming 1 is how it challenged me to think critically, break down complex problems, and find efficient solutions. It taught me the value of persistence, as debugging and refining code requires patience and attention to detail. The skills I gained from this course have become the cornerstone of my journey in the IT field, and I look forward to building on them as I continue to explore more advanced programming concepts in the future.            </div>
