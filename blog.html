                What I appreciate most about Computer Programming 1 is how it challenged me to think critically, break down complex problems, and find efficient solutions. It taught me the value of persistence, as debugging and refining code requires patience and attention to detail. The skills I gained from this course have become the cornerstone of my journey in the IT field, and I look forward to building on them as I continue to explore more advanced programming concepts in the future.            </div>
