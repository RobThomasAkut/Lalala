            <h1>What I’m Good At: <span>MMORPGs and FPS Games </span></h1>
            <p>
                When it comes to gaming, I’m in my element. I’ve spent countless hours mastering MMORPGs and FPS games, and it’s safe to say that these genres bring out the best in me. In MMORPGs, I thrive on strategy, coordination, and teamwork—whether I’m leading a guild to victory in a raid or crafting the perfect build to dominate in PvP. The deep, immersive worlds and complex mechanics of these games fuel my problem-solving and adaptability, and I’ve honed a unique ability to read the game’s flow and make split-second decisions.            </p>

            <p>
                In FPS games, my reflexes and precision take center stage. From sniping at long range to pushing objectives in fast-paced team matches, I’ve developed the quick thinking and hand-eye coordination needed to outsmart and outplay my opponents. My competitive spirit and drive to improve mean that I’m constantly refining my gameplay, always striving to be one step ahead.

                Both of these genres have not only helped me build valuable skills like focus, strategy, and quick decision-making but also taught me how to work effectively in high-pressure situations—skills that go beyond gaming and translate well into everyday life.            </div>
